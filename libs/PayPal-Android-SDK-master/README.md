PayPal Android SDK
==================

The PayPal Android SDK provides a software library that makes it easy for Android developers
to accept both credit cards and PayPal directly within native mobile apps.

For usage and integration instructions, see the
[PayPal Android SDK Integration Guide](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/integration/mobile/android-integration-guide/).

For detailed reference, see the [SDK reference](http://paypal.github.io/PayPal-Android-SDK/).

Older libraries
---------------

PayPal is replacing the [Mobile Payments Libraries (MPL)](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/classic/mobile/gs_MPL/)
with the PayPal iOS/Android SDK. The PayPal iOS/Android SDK is currently available in the US,
with more country support coming soon. US developers should upgrade now for more features
and a better mobile experience. Non-US developers can continue to use MPL for the time
being. Issues related to MPL should be filed in the [sdk-packages repo](https://github.com/paypal/sdk-packages/).

Developers with existing Express Checkout integrations or who want additional
features such as authorization and capture, may wish to use [Mobile Express Checkout](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/docs/classic/mobile/gs_MEC/)
in a webview.
